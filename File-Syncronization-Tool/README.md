Programm that implement a file synchronization tool in C called file_sync.c. The program will compare files between two directories and copy newer or missing files from a source directory to a destination directory. This practical utility demonstrates the use of key system calls such as chdir(), getcwd(), fork(), exec(), and wait().

Objectives

Gain hands-on experience with file system navigation using chdir() and getcwd()
Practice process creation and management with fork(), exec(), and wait()
Learn to work with directory content and file attributes
