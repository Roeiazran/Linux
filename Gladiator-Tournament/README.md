Gladiator Tournament

Introduction

In this assignment, you are tasked with implementing a tournament between gladiators. Each gladiator is represented as a process, and their fight is executed in a series of forked child processes. The tournament will declare the winner based on the last gladiator standing after the sequence of battles.

The project will use various system calls and concepts, including fork(), exec(), wait(), file descriptors, and process management, to simulate the tournament. Additionally, you'll be working with logging to file, where each gladiator logs their actions, health, and attack values.
